# ðŸ“§ EMAIL TEMPLATES

All email templates must include both `.html.j2` and `.txt.j2` versions.

## Why Two Versions?

`.html.j2` â€“ This is the HTML version of the email. It allows for rich formatting like bold text, clickable links, colors, and images. Most modern email clients support and prefer HTML emails.

`.txt.j2` â€“ This is the plain text fallback version. It is displayed when:

* The recipient's email client does not support HTML

* The recipient has chosen to view only plain text emails

* There's a deliverability issue that strips HTML content

Ensuring both versions are available increases compatibility and improves email deliverability, accessibility, and readability.

## File Naming Convention

Each email template should have the following structure:

```txt
emails/
  â””â”€â”€ job_posted.html.j2
  â””â”€â”€ job_posted.txt.j2
```

The two files should have matching base names and live in the `templates/emails/` directory (or wherever Flask/Jinja templates are located).

## Jinja Support

These templates use [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) syntax, which allows you to:

* Inject variables (e.g. `{{ user.first_name }}`, `{{ job_title }}`)

* Use control logic (e.g. `{% if ... %}` / `{% for ... %}`)

Variables passed into these templates will come from your Flask views or email-sending utility.

## âœ… Best Practices

* Keep `.txt.j2` messages clean and readable without relying on HTML formatting.

* Use the same content and structure between `.html.j2` and `.txt.j2` where possible.

* Test your email output by rendering and sending both versions.
